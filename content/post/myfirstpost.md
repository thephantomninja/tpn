Certainly an interesting name for a blog. You can read my [\#whoami]({{< ref "about.md" >}}) post for more background on me. 

I'm looking forward to providing useful content here on many topics - primarily technology and personal finance. Those topics will overlap often, as personal finance is much easier when technology is used properly.

This blog was born out of the need for an outlet for technology and finance-related discussions. I spend most of my time in one of the two areas, and am passionate about both. I listen to several daily/weekly [\#podcasts]({{< ref "podcasts.md" >}}) to further my learning in both areas. That said, I listen to podcasts that are of differing opinions - especially in finance. This helps me find a balanced approach to personal finance that works within my worldview and personal beliefs.

My first series of posts will be discussing how I built this blog, and the technologies used. I found it wasn't as easy as I wanted to find a static-site generator + hosting + setup tutorial for the entire process. For those wanting an inexpensive setup for a personal blog, you'll want to take a look!
