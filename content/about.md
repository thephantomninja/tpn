Hi. The Phantom Ninja blog is dedicated to discussing my passions. Namely, technology and personal finance. I specifically love (useful) mobile applications, security and living debt free. 

#### Why would you want my opinion? 

That's a good question, and I hope you find the answer to that as you delve into the content here.

#### What's my story?

Parts of my story will be told amongst my posts here. For background, however, some highlights are below:

<li> 15 years in the technology industry - including enterprise IT, audio/video, lighting and consumer tech
<li> I love history
<li> 2016 is a year or pursuing technical certifications (and writing about it)
<li> paid off over $40,000 in personal/consumer debt
